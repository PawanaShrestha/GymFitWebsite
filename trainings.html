                            It’s time to roll out your yoga mat and discover the calm and composing yoga.
                            The beauty of yoga is that you don’t have to be a yogi or yogini to reap the benefits.
                            Don’t be intimidated by yoga terminology, fancy yoga studios and complicated poses. 
                            Yoga is for everyone.
                            Acknowledging the limitless benefits of yoga, we have the perfect yoga trainer for you 
                            who has been into yoga for several years now.
                            Ms. Ashika Gurung will be assisting you with yoga every morning from 06:00 am to 08:00 am.
                            We have the calm and composing yoga session each weekday.

                        <p>
                            Each Zumba class is designed to bring people together to sweat it on.
                            In GYM Fit, "work" is taken out of the word "workout" mixing both low-intensity and 
                            high-intensity moves for an interval-style, calorie-burning dance fitness party. 
                            Once the Latin and World rhythms take over, 
                            you'll see why Zumba classes are often called exercise in disguise.
                            The most energetic and enthusiastic Niti Shakya will be making all bodies move to the beauty
                            and make your body toned in the most fun way possible.

                            What’s the first thing you think of when you hear “cardio?” 
                            Probably running, maybe the elliptical machine, stationary bike, or even rowing. 
                            But there’s so much more to cardiorespiratory training than steady-state endurance workouts—
                            a.k.a. trucking it for the long-haul.
                            The best kind of cardio happens to be compound exercises, 
                            which involve multiple joints and more than one muscle group.
                            With a little creativity, you can put together a fitness routine that 
                            includes a wide range of effective cardio exercises to build muscle, burn calories, and feel better.
